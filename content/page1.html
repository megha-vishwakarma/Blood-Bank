          <h2>Red Ray - A Blood Bank Management System</h2>      
          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          The Red Ray is to create an e-Information about the donor and organizationthat are related to donating the blood. Through this application any person who is interested indonating the blood can register himself in the same way if any organization wants to register itself with this site that can also register.
          Blood, a vital constituent, is important in the life of every organism living on earth. 
          Blood banks play an important role in storing and providing blood during treatment. 
          An injured person may lose their life, if they are unable to get blood transfusion 
          at the right time. Hence, there is an urgent need to establish a proper system where 
          blood availability and contacting a blood donor is easily accessible to those in need. 
          The Blood Bank Management System is a solution to all these problems, it can help in 
          saving precious lives of people by making the process of getting the right blood at 
          the right time a lot more efficient and time-saving.
          <h2>Problem Description</h2>
          The main aim of developing this system is to provide blood to the people who are in need of bloodAs we know, a blood bank plays a very important role in treatments of major injuries or surgeries. 
          If blood is not supplied to a patient within a set period of time, the patient's chances of losing 
          their lives increases dramatically. It is also obvious that conventional blood bank systems have a 
          lot of disadvantages, they are quite time-consuming, error-prone and also lack in data-integrity. 
          To overcome these problems, the project Blood Bank Management System is proposed. This project follows 
          a hypothetical example of a blood bank named Red Bank, which is a charitable chain of blood banks with 
          branches all over India. Red Bank wants to build an interactive and simple to use web application for 
          day to day users. This application would maintain information of both blood banks as well as blood 
          camps, hospitals and donors, which makes the entire process of blood transfusion easier. It will 
          enable users to easily check availability of different blood types and also locate the nearest branches. 
          They can also request a specific blood type easily and can also register themselves as donors. 
          Donors can check for Blood camps and hospitals for blood banks and will be getting notifications in case of emergency.
